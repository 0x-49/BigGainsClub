His trades and concepts are effective. Unfortunately, the trades he makes occur while I'm driving to work. I'll be back after the Daylight Saving Time change, which will allow me to trade during the first hour of the NY session and follow along. Thanks!

He promoted a trading bot claiming hedge funds wanted to buy just to scam 100 people and now no one answers. Ant scammed 100 people for $2500

00:00:00	I'm like hey I want to join the Army how fast can I get shipped out what the hell are you doing give up on it like 20 something th000 I was like down to like 1,200 or something I think one of the biggest things that helped me and I've never shared actually this story with anybody is uh I went on a trip to Miami with some friends and one of those nights met a gentleman that invited me to a house party so was a big mansion I go to the party I noticed it was kind of fun something weird about the party it

00:00:32	happened to be a diddy party wao whoo W whoa whoa whoa whoa whoo hey hey many of you guys know me as the games Club probably came across my social media not of the people know my stories but I was actually born in Italy I was born in Italy southern Italy in a place called Castell Mar dbia it's near the malf coast beautiful place to grow up but growing up in Italy there's not much of entrepreneurial you know things it's just not much of that my parents were all about go to school get a good job try to be a doctor lawyer one of those

00:01:00	cliche jobs but something happened in 2008 my dad won a green card uh Lottery visa to move to the United States then 2009 he decided he was going to move I moved alongside with him I was about 11 at that time that was in U June actually I think it was June 8th exactly of 2009 he was moving to Southern California near San Diego which is actually a pretty good area uh he had remarried and uh my stepmom had an aunt that lived in San Diego because her husband was in the military so I moved to San Diego and I

00:01:29	started Living that American life I knew no English I knew literally nothing about America I was very excited about all that now that I had moved to America I was going to middle school and high school and I always tght to myself that I never wanted to go to a job I didn't want to have like I didn't have any aspirations to look for like a job so through my high school years I was spending a lot of time watching like just anything that how to start a business Drop Shipping going do sales door too I would even went to a swap me

00:01:55	once with a buddy of mine and we would like go around the swap me and ask people if we could be their sales man and sell all these like small like BS items it's like S V me is like a market we made like $20 over the course of 12 hours that weekend which was not a lot of money I always kind of had that image I wanted to do something I just didn't know what it was then around my junior year of high school in 200 I think this was like 2012 13 at the time I would watch L night some YouTube videos and it

00:02:21	will come across these ads of people that were day trading and investing and it kind of caught my eyes but I didn't do much then in 2014 when I was graduating my my senior year uh I really kind of got more into it with Timothy syy he was one of the first OG investor Traders type of kind of gurus so I kind of looked into it but again I was underage 17 at the time nobody was into trading at all my parents were not for it so I couldn't really like actually do it but I stuck in my head then I graduated and I had to make a choice I

00:02:49	was like do I go to college do I not my best friend was a year older than me and he joined Army Reserve so literally in August like a week before I was supposed to go to college I said this I'm not going left I didn't go to college and I went to the Army recruiter in my town and I'm like hey I want to join the Army how fast can I get shipped out they're like well in 4 weeks if you uh we are shipping like some people out you want AG go we give you like an extra bonus it was like I think it's was called a

00:03:13	$5,000 quick ship bonus or something like that so I signed up I'm like you know what this I'm signing up so I signed up go home that same day I didn't tell my parents I'm like well you know I'm signing up for the military but I'm still 17 I hadn't turn 18 yet I need you guys to sign off on it my dad was actually in the military in Italy when he was younger so he was all for it he was you know great benefits go ahead so I go join the Army and it's the Army Reserve so I go do my boot camp I'll go

00:03:36	do my AIT school and I come back I get a nice little bonus from the Army not a lot of money but I had about1 $15,000 in my bank account so that was actually how I got my first money to be a day trader so after my boot camp and my AIT I come back home since I'm in Army Reserve I'm only going a weekend out of the month to go do my Army business and the rest of the time I decided I'm going to go back to college so I joined community college near my house and I had a little bit of chunk of change in my bank account cuz I

00:04:04	had gone in the Army I had about 12 $14,000 something around there and now I can actually kind of get into this trading thing so I'm going to school but on the side watching YouTube videos I'm learning now this around 2015 20 going to 2016 and I get really lucky in one of my history classes there was a guy that sat in the back and I was one of those kids that always set in the back and he was day trading this was around when Trump had just like was going to be elected or just got elected and he would

00:04:30	tell me like yeah man we got to buy options contracts for all the war stocks you know the wars are going to go down Trump is getting elected and now I'm like you know I'm into this trading [ __ ] you know I've been watching videos I've been kind of like paper trading messing around I sent up to a broker I put I think it was around $2,500 I go all in on the LTM or LMT one of those what I forgot what the exact ticker was but they make missiles for the United States Army and again I'm in the Army so I'm

00:04:53	like yeah this is this is definitely going down we lose it all right but me having a friend that was also into day trading had me motivated we talk after class before class we get into it then I got another good friend of mine in day trading too his name was Nathan and yeah we just stock it out and we just all were like kind of study together eventually they stopped trying but I just really loved it like I wasn't even thinking about the money I wasn't really thinking about like really making that

00:05:16	much money cuz I didn't have that much money to put in anyway so I just kept learning I kept studying and it took me a long time it was until like 2018 and and going to 2019 I start making some decent money and keep in mind you know I started in 2014 2015 when I kind of got into it it was until and I started seeing progress and start making money but part of it it was because I was hard-headed I did not look for a mentor I did not really buy any courses I was just trying to study on YouTube put some

00:05:40	money in from my jobs the army that I was doing lose it and go to college this kind of was the routine I was in took me long years then eventually developed my strategy and then 2020 was my big breakout year I think with a lot of other Traders 2020 had so many opportunities so if you had any type of experience which at this point I had a good amount of experience and I was already making some decent money that really took me to the next step that's when I really started making ton of money from Trading cuz we had

00:06:05	opportunity after opportunity and the way I like to call it it's kind of like it was the Super Bowl of stock Traders if you're trading whatever you were trading Tesla penny stocks NASDAQ it did not really matter even crypto everything was blowing up so if you had experience you were capitalizing on that and I tell people like the biggest thing with trading or any business is really is you put in a lot of years of work and you don't see much like I you you you feel like there's not really much change like

00:06:28	man it's been 2 years I'm still losing money but then just something clicks the opportunity comes to you and you take that to the next level and that's kind of what my journey was there was a lot of years of grinding a lot of years on not knowing if anything was going to work out and then it all worked out so my parents were from the same small town that I grew up everybody that I actually know my parents my grandparents are all from the same like rural area of near the malf coast in Italy they actually were a little bit of

00:06:56	a black ship in their family they had started having kids when they were 16 and 17 so High School right which in in Italy it's like really like really against it right because they you got to go to you go to school get married and then you have kids so they had me I was their third kid when they were 21 already so they had you know they had kids at 16 17 I think it was 18 19 and I was the third one at 21 then the divorce a couple years after I was born my mom actually I were living with her but then

00:07:20	she ended up getting remarried and she just moved to NN Italy it was me and my two sisters we moved back in with my dad that he was living with his grandma and and two of his other siblings so we're living with her and then my uh Grandpa was also there my mom she didn't really go to school she didn't really do much she worked like just regular jobs at like the grocery store while my dad he was in the military and then he was a police officer in Italy so then he and he was trying to go to school to be a

00:07:47	lawyer so he would go to school at night so he worked during the day go to school at night I bar really saw him so I spent a lot of time with my uncle and grandparents and he at the school he met another woman remarried and right when he was with her that's when he won his green card Lottery come to America and that's when I decided I was like well I can stay in Italy live with my grandparents but the Italian economy is not the best there's not opportunities here and you know America just sounded

00:08:14	awesome so my dad moved there and then I moved about a couple months after that that I deci I'm like you know what I'm moving and I was a 11 and 12 my other sister moved with me my older one but then my oldest one decided to stay in Italy and eventually move to America like 10 years later I think being in military probably gave me a ton of tools that I use today at really young age I live the house I'm on my own and if you go to boot camp like nobody's looking out for you you got to figure your own [ __ ] out doesn't matter

00:08:40	if you're 17 21 25 you got drill surgeons yelling at you and it kind of teaches you like how the problem solves they put you in situations that you kind of have to think also he taught me about being on my own right not relying on family or other people if I have issues like I'm on my own got to figure it out you don't even have a phone for 3 months so that's like how much you are kind of your own world it teaches you right waking up early working hard not complaining all those things that like

00:09:05	nowadays especially a lot of people are lacking so it gives you that level of work ethic uh and obviously it was like a on a money standpoint they you know they gave me the bonuses they they were paying me when you know I didn't really have any other money going into it which of course helped me so I think it's a great experience for people especially if you don't know what you're doing if you're like man I'm 18 going to college I'm going get all these student loans but I don't know if I actually like the

00:09:27	career that I'm doing I think the Army and special Reserve because you only committing really 6 months and then just like a weekend out of the a weekend every month after that I feel like can give you like a different perspective on find out what you like and where you want to go with your life cuz it was after the army that decided like you know I'm going to school but I'm going to school for business so even if I wasn't a day trader I would have probably been part of either starting a business running businesses something

00:09:50	that wasn't like a regular 95 job like a lot of people like kind of go to school for Teacher lawyer any other sort well to get into day trading I think it's a lot different than what it was for me back when I started I'm telling you the community was Tiny there was nobody talking about it everybody thought it was a scam nobody was doing it nowadays I think that people are a little bit easier to get into it they see a lot more often it's a lot more common that somebody tries to get into it it's even a lot easier right you have

00:10:20	these non-commission Brokers Robin Hood a quick app you can download so getting into it is actually really really easy but then it hurts the actual people that are getting into it cuz making making it so easy you think it's an easy skill to master well no it's really hard skill to master and partially is because people just kind of get into it for the wrong reasons most people they want to get into day trading they want to do it for the money right they're like hey I see this guy he makes a lot of money does it

00:10:44	from home travels let me just get into it I can do the same in 6 months but the reality is that that the more you chase the money the harder it gets because you're focused on the money and as I mentioned earlier like I was never personally focused on the money I just really enjoyed that so if you fall in love with that process of trial and error losing not giving up keeping data mastering your strategy back testing it enjoying looking at the charts then you'll find success but you have to understand it'll take some time it's

00:11:08	going to take you what took me which was 4 years you could probably do it much faster but it's all about having the right mindset I'm okay risking more because I'm all you know within the profits well I think everybody should try day trading I think it's by far in a way the best skill that you can Master because one is a skill that nobody takes away from you you master it that's it it's not I trust me I've tried Drop Shipping all these other [ __ ] it's not you trying to build a store deal with

00:11:37	customers reviews right some people might like that me personally I hate that your store can go down fads move on from one to the other right you have expenses you have overheads you have a lot of difficult things to deal with but with day trading I just take my trades it's me versus me I close my trade I'm done for day I got no stress I can go to sleep happy I don't got to worry about nobody calling me right now it doesn't mean it's easy I think it's a skill that like doesn't matter where you are like

00:12:03	what business you're in if you just if you work in regular 95 it never hurts to just add something to you know add a skill like that and when you get into it you don't even need to spend money right there's paper trading which is a demo account it's an account with fake money you can mess around you can learn that way watch videos and nowadays it's way easier than when I started CU you have something called propietary firms also known as Prof firms where you put a little bit of money 50 bucks 100 bucks

00:12:25	to get an account and if you pass their challenges they give you that account to trade and you can actually withdraw uh now not everybody you you might get into day TR and you're like this sucks I hate it then you know whatever you you stop doing it but I think everybody should look into it and there's no such thing as like hey everybody's getting into this business it's getting like it's hard to make money now now no it's not because it's just the markets it's it's stock market it's billions of dollars

00:12:47	traded it doesn't matter the more people the better there's more volatility there's more money going around more opportunities it's not like those guys are teaching you like oh sell this product on Drop Shipping or on Amazon cuz it's like if the product was doing well well then why would you want competitors in that same field here there's no competitors it's just you make money get out there nobody's going to bother you it's just you versus yourself you versus the markets yeah of course I met my wife in

00:13:14	20188 towards the end of it so I was able to get her number and try to get a date with her for months it was actually three different dates we were supposed to go on and then she would flag on me last minute uh but I didn't give up just like with trading I stuck to it kept you know trying to figure it out then eventually I was able to get one day with her that's all it took things went great from the first day and yeah then uh there was the end of 2018 then end of 2019 you move things pretty quickly

00:13:41	that's when you got pregnant with my son and then he was born in 2020 I think when you have a kid like a lot of people are scared of it and I get that but it does give you an extra motivation because it's I think it's humans in general it's not we're we'll work harder for others than we will work hard for ourselves cuz now yes I have my wife I had my family but I now have have a son too which is like okay you really want to make your kid proud so that gave me just extra motivation to keep working

00:14:05	hard and the benefits of being a day trader was that I'm at home all the time so when he gets I drop him off of school pick him up from school I'm there all the time right my my dad had to work hard right and I respect a lot he wasn't really as often as he could have been around me you know my sisters he had to work he had to go to school he was divorced but I get to be my son all the time and I think that helps him grow up right get that confidence his dad's always there is worry about anything now

00:14:30	the money secondary is nice but I think the fact that I can just be there for him regardless of the money is by far like the best thing possible the biggest struggle for me and for many others is the fact that nobody supports you right you talk to your parents you talk to your family talk to your friends everybody's like what the hell are you doing give up on it and the fact that you have to push yourself with no external motivation to keep going it's not easy there's nobody you can really talk to about it especially back

00:14:56	when I started and I think a lot of people relate with just bus business in general you try to start a business try to start something different it's not the usual 9 to5 that everybody does go to college and you find just like nobody supports you for that but then when you actually make it everybody claps for you and like yeah we knew you could do it when you remember them well that wasn't the case like I remember everything I remember everything everybody said now I don't hold that against them anymore

00:15:18	because I understand that you know from their point of view they still they just one the best out of me and you know they just didn't see the vision uh so that was the hardest part seeing the vision and seeing it by yourself so growing up we had a pretty like middle to lower middle class family again my dad was police officer my mom just work random job now we never like had issues we never didn't have food or anything like that we always had like a roof over our head luckily we had a supportive like grandparents a lot of

00:15:46	times I would usually eat at my grandparents' house uh because they drop us off for the day and they'd be busy doing you know going to work and things like that so we never like had anything crazy like Christmas wasn't getting a million gifts uh but also you know I'm thankful that I just there people that were in a lot tougher situations that I was in didn't have running water things like that uh but you know it was just a very humble life am I happy I think I'm very happy for where I'm at now I've always been a

00:16:13	happy person even when I had know money I was always happy now do I have bad day am I unhappy am I feeling down a certain day yes just because you have money it does not make any difference I feel the same amount of Happiness versus sad days than when I had no money now would I be extremely unhappy if I had literally no money and no roof over my head and like being a really terrible situation yes I'm sure that's the case so having the Baseline of enough money that's like hey I'm not not going to go hungry this week

00:16:39	I'm not going to be [ __ ] homeless I can take a shower I can H up the gym I have a car to give me around like that's the Baseline of happiness and anything above it makes you slightly happier but doesn't really do a huge huge difference is I compare this a lot to going to the gym you don't go to the gym at all but you go one day out of the week you'll see really really big difference now you go two days you'll still see a big difference but not as big of a difference from 0 to one then you go three times a week now the gym you'll

00:17:04	see a nice nice difference from going twice to three times but much less then going just twice then you go four five times you start seeing much less difference than that first jump from 0 to one 0 to two then you go six to seven times you'll see very very very small difference of somebody that goes seven times versus five times now would say happinesses like that you get to a certain point of money that like it makes a slight difference uh but you know overall it's not a huge difference well I'm one of those people

00:17:33	that I kind of love my work like I know it's cliche it's like find something that you love it's like I never feel like I'm really working now that when I'm on the charts trading it's usually going to be 3 to 5 hours max a day sometimes even less right like that's depending on my day sometimes just an hour sometimes I take the day off but like everything else like making videos to help others to talk to other people to help them get better that to me doesn't feel like I'm ever working now some people might see it as such for me

00:17:59	I just enjoy it so much so I feel like if I'm not working actually if I'm not doing something productive I get stressed out I get anxiety I'm like I feel like I should be doing something productive I hate just sitting around doing nothing uh especially if it's like I'm just by myself like if I'm on a trip with a family it's a little bit of different story but like the feeling of like I should be doing something productive I kind of always have that feeling so like I quite enjoy it some people might think I work too much and

00:18:21	kind of like a workaholic but to me it's like I'm helping others I'm enjoying it I'm doing the passion I've had for the last 11 years going on now so to me never feels like work if I'm on a trip usually I'm still trading I'm still looking at the markets so you know I just see as part of Just My Lifestyle at this point it's all together hope you guys enjoy this video and understand that I'm really doing this for you I love making these videos to help others due to all the messages I get and all the people that my YouTube is not even

----
00:00:00	what's going on everybody and welcome back to the channel today's video we wait let me adjust this what the all right there you go much better what's going on today in today's video we're going to talk about what we did in the market today and also yesterday yesterday an insane like boom Banger type and you guys were like tra recap tra recap I've been super busy so I was not able to do it yesterday but don't worry we'll we'll do today uh we uh took a sculpt today we'll go over that one it was not like look at the

00:00:28	market guys like this was the New York was right here 9:30 like and this was like all way till 1200 like there was just we took a sculp it was like 450 points likely the range was kind of big so even catching half of a 15-minute candle was like nice but it wasn't really anything crazy we we'll go over it first of all I was bearish in general this for this week I think we're going to good chance to hit the low of the previous week which was here reason being we look at larger time frame overall higher high low lower high equal

00:01:01	low Bel lower high here as price ended up closing right under that uh daily candle the daily fair value Gap so again in Q yes little bit the same so then yesterday going to the day I'm like hey uh I think we're going to be bearish because remember on Monday today is Wednesday Monday we took the shorts I had to trade recap for that and now we had retested that same level um when we look at in Q yesterday right test the halfway point of the daily for Value Gap clearing rejection on the 50 50 minute

00:01:30	and then we jump over the 5 minute and it was all she wrote right you had all set the Confluence you you were we had Target a daily fore Val Gap and that sponsored this move right here on the 5 minute and once this candle closed on this next 1 minute candle I was able to get in with a stop loss here he no I'm and I looked for all way to 450 guys it's all tra life you know I'm not not joking I'm making this up all through live posted live sh profits live with the team I said short and chill until

00:02:00	450 I'm going show you guys the screenshot from the Discord and on top of that if you do want to join the Discord L will be down below man join we're doing a free trial join a free trial check us out short until 450 yesterday these two people thought I was trolling I was not trolling man and we kept going lower if anything sh look for even lower but yeah what did I look for there the daily guys the daily if price is and I teach you guys this if price is fractal if price moves from daily down to the hourly down to

00:02:29	the five if you're getting a daily FAL projection which is sponsored by a move on the 5 minute FAL projection what does I tell you guys it's going to be stronger it's going to be more powerful that's how you find confluences and you line it up we had this small golden pocket that I look for the difference between me and you guys you guys learn a Confluence you learn what a feral Gap is you just looking for a feral app you learn what liquidity is you're just looking to black and white enter or not enter you

00:02:58	have to ask yourself this more important questions what is the larger time frame and is that sponsoring move to the downside right if it's so then it's a higher probability setup guys all right if you do want more an idea on how high probability setups work if you go to any my Instagram videos and just reply uh checklist I will DM you kind of like a checklist of uh what I look for and what makx a high quality setup versus a low quality setup so then we had this move down and it was beautiful and we held

00:03:31	them we got to 450 we took profit and then the price came into the day and if we look at the 4 Hour guys what do we see what do I tell you guys let's go to four hours here big day the previous day we just move up and then big day they move down on the daily it's even more kind of obvious you see if anything there's three big days if you look at Friday so Friday big directional day Monday big directional day Tuesday big directional day does it tell you usually usually it tells you that the following day the fourth day is

00:04:03	extremely extremely unlikely you get another big movement day so you have to go into that day not really looking for anything and just expecting some chop and focus on the sculps that's when you size into a trade when you have an idea on price continuing have continuation that day versus not when price is not having continuation continuation you just look for the smaller sculps that's when it's fine to sculp or not even take a trade at that for example here like you see the dollar time frame the daily

00:04:30	is not this bonds up is not getting sponsored by anything there's nothing on the larger time frame that really want you to say hey this should bonds really strong now there's a couple key points like there was this 4our equal lows that we targeted uh that could give you nice bounce but nothing nothing really major so more than likely I'm expecting price to do this and then come down and do a little bit lower we all have to see on that but you can see price is just sugesting it's jesting this big move and

00:04:56	this down move you have to understand price is not always going to be mooning right so or or tanking so always going to be One Direction so you do have to be careful and understand when side's in and sides down today told everybody I'm looking for a sculp you come to the five minutes New York open look at at 9:30 and um if you're in a Discord right you have me telling you guys this and really helps the time because I'm giving you the confluences I'm giving you what you're looking for said hey unless we

00:05:20	break out of this or cleanly break below this there's not really trade here there's nothing in here to trade now we found a little scul that we took that was a short right here this was a one minute short with about a 20 point stop targeting this low right here and I thought hopefully we would if we break below this we would have got like probably a 200 Point move to the downside but we did not we were able to catch this and then Runners get stopped out in green and also guys if you follow me on Tik Tok or on Twitter if you not

00:05:49	you should this was uh we were right at the daily opening Gap so if you mark your daily opening gap which is right here that's where sorry not the daily I'm sorry the yearly right the yearly guys you guys are like what the you need the yearly for 21 35 bounce bounce see what I'm saying here faked this is trap a manipulation move run run back up but uh that's that's what was press press is happening like I did not look for home run I told you guys I was looking for a scalp 60 points for me a scalp you follow some Traders you look

00:06:23	out there and they're like wow like 60 points is like their full TP and maybe even less is it m that that's line back is like bro like chill the lighning back is like need to chill hold on it me or the light here let me put a gr yeah I get the app look at that I feel like the light in the back I just saw it's like bro like chill the out man chill the out light in the back chill out but yeah I knew coin to dat is going to be sideways days and this is where you want to be sized down guys there is

00:06:54	studies that have shown to most profitable Traders understand when to say in and went to size down so I stayed um you know I I stayed size down today I said looking for sculp right today we also have FC minutes usually doesn't do anything crazy for the markets the minutes people get confused with the real fomc but regardless I understood uh then the more price is going to adjust tomorrow Market is going to be closed because of Jimmy Carter I think I honestly I don't even know who the that was I guess it's a president I

00:07:24	don't know we passed away RP then Friday hopefully we should get a DEC recently recent B big move and as I said I'm still expecting lower this could change uh depending on the price action works now I've been staying away from yes yes has been okay like yesterday gave like a really nice short idea too there was a lot of smts uh yesterday with the bearish Divergence playing out so there was some ideas but inq has been really good since the beginning of the year and I'm going to be keep uh keep trading that right so

00:07:55	for the beginning of the year I'm already up well over six figures and I hope to continue that the has been due to my uh bearish bu bearish buess the last few days now I do want to say if you do want to go to my Twitter guys go to my Twitter and I promise you it's going to be really really helpful you do this go to my Twitter I've been doing I've been posting where price is going to go every single day as you can see this was my idea yesterday under 37 sorry uh I posted yesterday for today under 372 take a short 282 which played

00:08:25	out and even more you can see I also showed ideas I'm sharing on Twitter on hosting them of course it's not all my trades that take live with the team but there some really solid idea and look at this like you go down and look at it l great information guys go give it a follow I promise you you will not regret it and as always peace out for

00:00:00	what's going on everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about what happened today what did we trade it's Monday it was a tough uh it wasn't was like a tough session just like tricky tricky sessions I felt like I had a pretty decent re on the market apart from one moment through the day and I slipped up through that moment but luckily I was able to come back go back to initial plan short and get a really big 200 plus point1 win which I'm currently holding I do plan a swing

00:00:32	trade all the way down this 492 area hopefully I'll be able to maybe I want so going into the day we first have to look at the larger time frame right we always start off with the larger time frame and coming off that $21,000 bottom from uh last week that I called I was looking for push up to the 7 uh 45 area 745 750 area which I even tweeted before the market open so the night prior I was looking for that and a lot of people a lot of people saw it you know a lot people followed that and made a lot

00:01:08	money so if you're not following Twitter make sure you go out and follow Twitter I've been trying to post every single day some kind of update some kind of where the market is going and I'm being pretty damn accurate so that was what's going was going on larger time frame I was looking for rejection off the 7:45 and then potentially if that didn't hold up look for this rejection up on this four 4 for 4our fair value Gap fill also on the daily I was also potentially looking for this load to potentially get

00:01:35	taken out and see some kind of manipulation there and that's where I started to short I started to short right around there but the issue was as you can see we just chopped around the area a little too much I try to take an initial short here as then you I didn't show the exact tick of the high of that top so I tried to short uh with a confirmation so I shorter there um you know I play safe 20 point stop did that once did that again like roughly right here got stop hunted again then eventually decid hey this does look good

00:02:08	I took a third short at this and this was the one that you currently see and then um as you can see it played out I was able to hold it as you can see all the bullish level were getting disrespected and the bearish levels were getting respected one of the big questions I get asked at all time is T you how are you able to hold some of these trades like what are you looking for when a trade gets held and the main thing I'm looking for for holding a trade versus not holding a Traders one is are my bearish levels in this case

00:02:36	because I was on a short position getting respected yes good plan to hold them more bullish shels in this case because bullish will be the opposite of the bearish right are those levels getting disrespected yes the Net's telling you the Bears are in control and let your winers run like Good Old Warren Buffet said you know the old man is almost like 100 years old now what are your plans if you're winners going telling you exactly what you want to what what you want to see Let it play out but what's more

00:03:05	important about today it's very interesting it's like how I think about trading L you guys are just looking for a next YZ Model A Lot you guys are just looking hey this is the market it's G me a FAL Gap P GP something like that you just want to take it black and white the way I look at the market the Italian way the Italian concept the BGC concept is not really so much that I'm looking for hey I got these two British key areas near this and know like I'm going to want to look for shorts here I have

00:03:32	nothing here I'm not looking for anything I'm bullish up until that point up to was a 750 it was I'm looking just for bullish setups until then then when I'm in this area then I'm start looking for the bearish setups now bearish setups you could be a little too early like as you can see the bearish like if you look at this on hindsight this doesn't look like much draw down you're like oh you just took that little draw down like not a big deal the trade looks really good but in the moment you have

00:03:56	to understand you have to play safe I would rather stop out of take two losses that are smaller and then wait for the big winner to come and I know I'm going to make up my losses with that versus holding and like hey I was completely wrong CU if this had popped open retests and then keeps going that's how you blow up your account that's what you don't want to do you do not want to do that that's when you blow up your account so you have to be extremely careful with that so this is why I was bearish at

00:04:23	that area I had my daily level and I thought that this would be also a daily soup a soup as in like hey price is kind of fix this breakout move as you can see here just sits there and then comes down what you want to see with a true breakout let's say this is key area you want to see break up be a strong Candle One Candle usually two candles Max really breaks through and pushes above a level versus something like this this is what I would call a turtle soup you soup that key level that key point of

00:04:50	Interest High time frame Point POI and if you do that allow times to look for the reversal now on the smaller time frames if we pull up also let's pull up yes where yes where you where you at today I wasn't I barely looked at yes do we had a ton I feel like we had a ton diver is just near this high as you can see here in this ey uh yes also kind of start making but once we got into right here we start seeing that off this 1110 candle we got starting to see getting a bearish Divergence after that so again

00:05:24	another one another reason what I was looking for also on yes very similarly uh on the 4our you tapped uh you did not tap into that 4our um fill like you just didn't fill it by a couple points but you did feel the daily F Val Gap right there right and look where we're closing so tomorrow what do we expect tomorrow I'm expecting some more bearish right for the week I'm expecting bearish for this week of today's monday6 24 f 25 holy I'm expecting a new low week by Friday we claim we'll see see if it

00:06:00	plays out but that's what I would like to see on this small time frame then I just look for the usual guys the usual entry targets um inversions some kind of retracing between GP different confirmations like here this could have been your inversion uh you see here there's no inversions but this could have been your inversions right there you could have entered off of I realistically just took it off when we Clos under this key level and just set my stop at the high which was here which was like Hey I asked

00:06:31	myself like is this a safe enough stop that can just take that without much of Confluence yes 20 points I'm okay losing 20 points I need did week so I know my wins are going to be 40 50 60 100 200 300 points I know my wins are going to be much bigger and something about me with my tradings I'm not looking to take those 10 point sculps that's you guys have been in some of the people this score it's there might works for some people but I like to catch full real trade what trading is about trying to

00:06:57	predict price and it's so much of a Neo Just My Style Trading you can see you could have held this trade for a really really long time we'll see and I think it's over this 21 805 I probably stop out in the green and see after that how things play out after the market open and close of course if you're in a Prof room you can all do what I do exactly uh one of the things I would wish sorry this are the daily so one of the things is that yes took the this 920 low so that is what I'm saying maybe it'll flip back to

00:07:33	bullish or something like that is now I'm thinking hey we have a pretty large Divergence off of this right people were like yo why didn't take out loow and yes didn't well look at look at yes was there Divergence yes there was and overall if you look today um inq was just stronger regardless now we really like to see price reject off this of this low right here this 10 a.m. low this 10 a.m. candle uh that could have been a potential long as well in there earlier in the day you see this long right here you have this

00:08:07	50 minute for R Gap and Q at the 10: a.m. orange folder News you tapped into it gets bought up you could take into your next POI which was a77 use that your stop loss there's a lot of really interesting uh trades today uh the people L capitalize on it even this long week here in the five minutes there was a nice little AMD model so AMD accumul ation as you see here accumulation manipulations and then distributed to the high time fori it was another potential setup was a 930 I saw it but it was at 9:30 so didn't really want to

00:08:40	enter right off the open but this year I did see a play out so hope this video helped you guys I'm literally fried I've been so busy meetings with trade full with just so much I have the podcast to go to in literally like five minutes but a lot of people been asking me why did you take your trade you do a little trade breakdown hope this video did help uh and I have a ton of like new exciting YouTube videos like I can't wait till you guys see I'm start dropping them we're trying to get Bunch recorded and try we'll drop them January
